=============================
This is for the project of "Developing Data Products" course. 

Myapplication illustrates the superposition of two wave. Users can adjust the amplitude, frequency and phase of two individual 
waves and watch how the superposition and shape of individual waves are affected by these three parameters.

This repository has the ui.R and server.R for my application. The include.Rmd file has the documentation for this application. The documentation also shows on the webpage of the application.

The application can be accessed at the following URL: https://bursi.shinyapps.io/DataProductsProjectShiny/
